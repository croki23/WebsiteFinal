        <h1>What I Learned In</h1>
        <h5>WS 101:<span> Web Systems And Technologies 1</span></h5>
        <p>I've picked up a bunch of new skills, like figuring out how to connect JavaScript files using import and export functions. I've also learned how to make websites with different pages, and I can now build systems where you can add, check off, delete, and see your tasks. This class has really helped me get better at designing, especially with CSS. CSS has been super useful for making my webpages and systems look colorful and cool. But hey, I'm still just starting out, so I'm working hard to get even better at CSS for whatever comes next.</p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/vincentroy23">Contact Me</a>
